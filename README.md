# RubyOnRailsProjects
A collection of my work using Ruby on Rails web development framework

recipeFinder - my first rails app! (https://recipefinder2165.herokuapp.com/)
	this app collects recipe data in json format from www.food2fork.com/api
	based on a search term that is usually set to be an ingredient. if the search term is not set, it defaults to the value 'chocolate'
